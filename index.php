	<h2 style="margin:10px; padding: 0%; ">MTG Packages is a community-based effort to organize, sort, and rank the best cards in "Magic: The Gathering" by overall function and archetype</h2>
	We've made finding cards through MTG Packages easy enough that it can be summarized in two simple steps:

	<h3 style="margin: 20px 0px 0px 0px; padding: 0%;">Step 1: Click the 5 dots up top to select a color combination</h3>
	The cards shown will only match the exact color combination. Searching for Boros (White & Red) won't give you mono-white or mono-red spells; it will only give you cards that are both white AND red.<br>
	Here are some example color combinations: <br>
	<img src="tutorial 1.jpg" alt="Click any of the 5 dots above to get a color combination" srcset="" style="height: 150px;">

	<h3 style="margin: 20px 0px 0px 0px; padding: 0%;">Step 2: Select an archetype, or "package", alongside the format you want to search under</h3>
	Click the button correlating to the package you want to search for, and we'll do the rest!<br>
	As soon as you click a package, you'll be whisked away to see the best ranked cards in that package!<br>
	<img src="tutorial 2.jpg" alt="Click the button correlating to the package you want to find" srcset="" style="max-width: 100%;">

	<h2 style=" margin:0%; padding: 0%; font-size: 150%;">Want to contribute to our data set? Vote for your favorite cards every week!</h2>
	Every card you see on MTG Packages has been selected by the community, for the community; without all of you guys, we wouldn't even have any data to show!<br>
	That's why we've made contributing to MTG Packages as easy as possible, while also taking steps to ensure that our data is still valid, and from actual players. 
	<h3 style="margin: 20px 0px 0px 0px; padding: 0%;">Step 1: Create an account (or sign into it if you already have one)</h3>
	To avoid trolling & ensure authenticity, an account is required to vote for cards. <br>
	However, everyone is free to browse the site & look at the most popular cards, with no account required!<br>
	You can create a new account from the login screen, so just click the login button even if you don't have one! <br>
	<img src="tutorial 3.jpg" alt="Click the login button" srcset="" style="height: 200px;">
	
	<h3 style="margin: 20px 0px 0px 0px; padding: 0%;">Step 2: Search for your favorite card; click on the one you want if there are multiple results</h3>
	If you know what card you want to vote for by name, search for it directly!<br>
	If you only know part of the name, search for it anyway! We'll find all the closest matches and give you a list to pick from.<br>
	<img src="tutorial 4.png" alt="Use the search bar to find a card" srcset="" style="height: 200px;">
	
	<h3 style="margin: 20px 0px 0px 0px; padding: 0%;">Step 3: Vote for your card as either a good example (green) or a bad example (red)</h3>
	Think a card works well in multiple packages at once? You can vote for that card in both at the same time! <br>
	Each package is treated seperately; Voting for a card in one package will not stop you from voting for it in another package: Even if it's the same week!<br>
	There is also no limit to how many cards you can vote for... But you can only vote for each card once per week! <br>
	<img src="tutorial 5.jpg" alt="The options on the left are positive ratings, the right are negative ratings" srcset="" style="height: 300px;">
	<img src="tutorial 6.jpg" alt="You should see the number go up right away when you click submit" srcset="" style="height: 300px;">
	
	<h3 style="margin: 20px 0px 0px 0px; padding: 0%;">Step 4: Watch your card go up in rank, and show up earlier in searches!</h3>
	When searching for a package, cards are sorted by their rank (or alphabetical if tied); voting for a card will give it higher priority in the search list!
	<img src="tutorial 7.png" alt="Results on the earch page are sorted by their rank in the selected package" srcset="" style="height: 400px;">
	
	<h3 style="margin: 20px 0px 0px 0px; padding: 0%;">Step 5: Come back next week to vote for it again! You can vote multiple times per card, but only once per week!</h3>
	We only track your votes on a card for 7 days. After that we delete the record of your vote, but not the vote itself. (the change to the score still stays, but now you can vote again!)<br>
	If everyone voted for a new card every time they came here, it would take us a week to collect enough data to rank almost every spell in Magic! <br>
	The MTG Packages team - all 1 of us - want to send a special 'thank you' to all the planeswalkers who put in the time and effort to contribute to our database, and to YOU, the user, for helping to make this dream a reality!
